Hey, I'm Rajdeep Mondal. I'm a data scientist and software engineer who enjoys building things and exploring new tech.

I mostly do LLMs, everything AI, and full-stack development of sorts. In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects, write tech articles, or try out new programming languages and tools.

On this site, I share what I've learned and projects I've built. If you'd like to chat, just reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajdeep-mondal/) or Twitter.
