I build AI agents that are useful.

When I’m not doing that, I:

- squash bugs in open-source projects,
- share quick notes about what I’ve learned,
- try out new programming tools, and
- read and re-create AI research for fun.

This site is my open notebook. You’ll find raw ideas, half-finished experiments, and the projects that made it to the finish line.
