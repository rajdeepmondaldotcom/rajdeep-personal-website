# ADR-001: Choosing Next.js App Router

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-01  
**Decision Makers:** Rajdeep Mondal

## Context

When building a modern personal website and blog, we need to choose a framework that provides:

1. Excellent performance out of the box
2. SEO optimization capabilities
3. Modern developer experience
4. TypeScript support
5. Active community and ecosystem
6. Future-proof architecture

## Decision

We will use **Next.js 15 with the App Router** as our primary framework.

## Rationale

### 1. Performance Benefits

The App Router provides several performance advantages:

- **Server Components by Default**: Reduces JavaScript bundle size by keeping components server-side
- **Streaming**: Progressive rendering improves perceived performance
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Each route gets its own bundle
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image, font, and script optimizations

### 2. Developer Experience

- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing based on file structure
- **Layouts**: Shared UI that doesn't re-render between navigations
- **Error Boundaries**: Better error handling with error.tsx files
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading UI with loading.tsx files
- **TypeScript First**: Excellent TypeScript support out of the box

### 3. SEO Advantages

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **Metadata API**: Type-safe metadata generation
- **Sitemap Generation**: Automatic sitemap.xml creation
- **Structured Data**: Easy implementation of JSON-LD

### 4. Modern Architecture

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx           # Home page
├── blog/
│   ├── layout.tsx     # Blog layout
│   ├── page.tsx       # Blog listing
│   └── [...slug]/
│       └── page.tsx   # Dynamic blog posts
└── api/
    └── newsletter/
        └── route.ts   # API endpoint
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Pages Router (Next.js)

**Pros:**

- More mature, battle-tested
- Larger community knowledge base
- Simpler mental model

**Cons:**

- Less performant (larger client bundles)
- No built-in layouts support
- More complex data fetching patterns

### 2. Gatsby

**Pros:**

- Excellent for static sites
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- GraphQL data layer

**Cons:**

- Slower build times for large sites
- Less flexibility for dynamic content
- Steeper learning curve with GraphQL

### 3. Astro

**Pros:**

- Zero JavaScript by default
- Multi-framework support
- Excellent performance

**Cons:**

- Newer, smaller ecosystem
- Less mature tooling
- Limited dynamic capabilities

### 4. Remix

**Pros:**

- Excellent nested routing
- Progressive enhancement focus
- Good error boundaries

**Cons:**

- Smaller ecosystem than Next.js
- Less built-in optimizations
- Newer, less proven at scale

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Performance**: Smaller bundles, faster page loads
2. **SEO**: Better search engine rankings
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Scalability**: Can grow from blog to full application
5. **Future-proof**: Aligned with React's direction

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve**: New concepts like Server Components
2. **Migration Complexity**: If coming from Pages Router
3. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Some libraries need updates
4. **Documentation**: Still evolving as patterns emerge

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Setup

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Phase 2: Route Structure

```
app/
├── (marketing)/        # Marketing pages group
│   ├── page.tsx       # Home
│   └── about/
│       └── page.tsx   # About
├── blog/              # Blog section
│   ├── page.tsx       # Blog listing
│   └── [...slug]/     # Dynamic routes
│       └── page.tsx   # Individual posts
└── api/               # API routes
    └── newsletter/
        └── route.ts   # Newsletter endpoint
```

### Phase 3: Optimizations

- Implement metadata generation
- Add sitemap and robots.txt
- Configure image optimization
- Set up font optimization

## Monitoring

We will monitor the success of this decision through:

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
   - Page load times
   - Bundle sizes

2. **Developer Productivity**
   - Time to implement features
   - Bug frequency
   - Developer satisfaction

3. **SEO Performance**
   - Search rankings
   - Organic traffic
   - Page indexing
